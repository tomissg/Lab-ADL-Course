# Lab-ADL-Course
This iss the repository for the Advnace Deep Learning course for Lab_0 

For this course there were 3 Task solved 

task_1.py consist a solution for a simple cnn with various different parameters

  -leaky relu activation and SGD optimiser
  -leaky relu activation and Adam optimeser 
  -tanh activation and Adam optimiser 
  
task_2.py has the solution for training Alexnet model 

  -fine tuning 
  -features extraction 
  
task_3.py train with tensorflow in mnist dataset and then use this pretraned model for training in SHVN dataset 

Functions.py consist of some function in order not to call them again and and again like some training loop or the cnn custom model
